* Shigeyuki Magi, Takahiro Maruyama, Seiji Takagi, Atsuhiko T Naito, Yuichi Hori. Machine Learning Analysis of Ocular Blood Flow for Estimating Vascular Age

## Overview

In this study, we developed machine learning models to predict chronological age using time-series blood flow images of ocular vessels captured through laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG). The inclusion of features generated through automated feature engineering enhanced the modelâ€™s accuracy compared to predefined features. The findings indicate that physiological alterations in vasculature are likely to be induced even at the prehypertension/prediabetes stage, which are reflected in changes in retinal blood flow patterns.
